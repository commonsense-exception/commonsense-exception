"I wondered if the pair of words for context needed to be adjectives. For example, with my scanner sentence, would something like ""When the scanner is plugged in, it [does/doesn't] work."" be acceptable? I imagine the AI is trying to learn words, so the more descriptive, the better and [does/doesn't] isn't that helpful. "
I know the sentence made mo sense but the original sentence made no sense to me...
"I found it pretty difficult to create one-word-only synonyms and position pairs. (Just FYI, not a complaint!) Also, it was a bit difficult to understand what ""The brace is open"" even means without more context. So I'm not sure if our answers need to be 100% correct or not, or if it's okay for them to be a bit of a stretch."
"It's rather difficult to make something like an odometer being different colors register for this format. An odometer being a different color doesn't really contradict anything-- other than it just being a separate color. In the berry example, you could easily do ""That berry is a [strawberry/blueberry]"" to indicate contradictions. For an odometer, there really isn't an easy go to, and I had to provide a very strange workaround. If there's something I'm missing in the process, please let me know! "
I used gone as my antonym for step 3 :)
"This one was fairly difficult because there isn't a really good antonym for electrified.  I understand the task, so if this one wasn't up to par, I apologize. "
Bit of a stretch coming up with the answer to step 3 - my only other thought was 'The ostrich could/couldn't lay eggs'
This is interesting! :)
Thanks for the opportunity.
I'd love more examples to help better understand the instructions - it took me some time to parse.
Is it okay to use hyphenated words like built-in?
"In both of the examples above, the [A/B] selection was at the end of each sentence; I put mine in the middle of the sentence, because I felt it better communicated the point. Should the [A/B] selection always be placed at the end of the sentence, or does it not matter, as long as it fits the requirements?"
Looking forward to it. 
I hope I did the second segment correctly! I look forward to working with you on this project! :) 
Hopefully I did it correctly.  Thank you. 
"I feel like I have to explain. Being ""stable"" is not a typical way of describing a calzone. So when its frozen it is stiff and ""stable"". When its cooked it becomes floppy and flimsy."
No.
The corkboard is [open/put away]
"There doesn't seem to be any antonyms for purple little less three, so from merriam webster I chose three, near antonyms, https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/purple"
