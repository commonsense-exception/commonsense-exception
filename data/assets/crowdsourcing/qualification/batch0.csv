4FRFD66TK6XE,scanner,dead,Working,Running,Operational,[broken/fixed],The scanner is [broken/fixed].,"I wondered if the pair of words for context needed to be adjectives. For example, with my scanner sentence, would something like ""When the scanner is plugged in, it [does/doesn't] work."" be acceptable? I imagine the AI is trying to learn words, so the more descriptive, the better and [does/doesn't] isn't that helpful. "

MEJWNVYTN6GW,odometer,red,Green,Blue,Black,[blood/leaves],The odometer is covered in [blood/leaves].,"It's rather difficult to make something like an odometer being different colors register for this format. An odometer being a different color doesn't really contradict anything-- other than it just being a separate color.

For an odometer, there really isn't an easy go to, and I had to provide a very strange workaround. If there's something I'm missing in the process, please let me know! "
